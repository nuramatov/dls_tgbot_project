# Telegram bot for style transfer
GAN being used is the official CycleGAN implementation (style_vangogh) taken from https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
# Commands:
/start - Start the bot
/cancel - Shutdown
# Using the bot
After you start the bot, it will ask you for the model you want to use (GAN or NST).
Then you send it the content picture, and a style image (if you chose NST) in separate messages.
After you receive the image, you should choose the model again.
